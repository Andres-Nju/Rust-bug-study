3749: Fix back: sort error message r=ManyTheFish a=ManyTheFish

This PR reintroduces the error message modified in https://github.com/meilisearch/milli/pull/375.
However, this added double-quotes around `sort` in the message. I don't think another message contains double-quotes, so I have added a separate commit replacing the double-quotes with back-ticks, which seems more consistent with the other error messages, this last change can be reverted easily.

## Detailed changes
#### v1.2-rc0
```
The sort ranking rule must be specified in the ranking rules settings to use the sort parameter at search time.
```
#### [Reintroduce fix (previous and expected behavior)](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/3749/commits/23d1c868259c3a7224e0df00e1469eb76a707851)
```
You must specify where "sort" is listed in the rankingRules setting to use the sort parameter at search time
```
#### [Replace double-quotes with back-ticks (my suggestion)](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/pull/3749/commits/4d691d071a700f5391364b16b286049973e3c494)
