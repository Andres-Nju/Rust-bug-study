3647: Improve the health route by ensuring lmdb is not down r=irevoire a=irevoire

Fixes #3644

In this PR, I try to make a small read on the `AuthController` and `IndexScheduler` databases.
The idea is not to validate that everything works but just to avoid the bug we had last time when lmdb was stuck forever.

In order to get access to the `AuthController` without going through the extractor, I need to wrap it in the `Data` type from `actix-web`.
And to do that, I had to patch our extractor so it works with the `Data` type as well.
