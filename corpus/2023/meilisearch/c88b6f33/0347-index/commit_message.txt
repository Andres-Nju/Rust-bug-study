3482: Optimize meilisearch uffizzi build r=curquiza a=waveywaves

# Pull Request

## Related issue
Fixes https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/3476

## What does this PR do?
even though docker cache was being used earlier for uffizzi builds, seems like the cache layers weren't persisting. This commit adds changes to move meilisearch building outside the dockerfile so that we can use the rust cache action. We are also building to the musl target so that the binary for meilisearch which is created can be used for the uffizzi ttyd image which uses alpine.

Meilisearch build time brought to 5 mins example https://github.com/waveywaves/meilisearch/actions/runs/4142776058

we also update the version of uffizzi action used here which fixes another uffizzi bug where the environments are not deployed. https://app.uffizzi.com/github.com/waveywaves/meilisearch/pull/2 was built as a part of a test for this PR and we can be sure that the deployment works well now.
