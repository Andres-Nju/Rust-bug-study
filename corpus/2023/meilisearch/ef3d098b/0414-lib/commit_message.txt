3976: Fix the get stats method r=ManyTheFish a=irevoire

# Pull Request

- The get stats method of the index-scheduler was not using at all the processing tasks. That was returning a wrong number of enqueued tasks and 0 processing tasks.
- Added a test
- Currently this method was **ONLY** used to compute the `meilisearch_nb_tasks` field of the **experimental feature** metrics.
