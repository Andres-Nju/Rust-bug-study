3986: Fix geo bounding box with strings r=ManyTheFish a=irevoire

# Pull Request

When sending a document with one geofield of type string (i.e.: `{ "_geo": { "lat": 12, "lng": "13" }}`), the geobounding box would exclude this document.

This PR fixes this issue by automatically parsing the string value in case we're working on a geofield.
