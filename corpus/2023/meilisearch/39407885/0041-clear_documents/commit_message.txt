3347: Enhance language detection r=irevoire a=ManyTheFish

## Summary

Some completely unrelated Languages can share the same characters, in Meilisearch we detect the Languages using `whatlang`, which works well on large texts but fails on small search queries leading to a bad segmentation and normalization of the query.

This PR now stores the Languages detected during the indexing in order to reduce the Languages list that can be detected during the search.

## Detail

- Create a 19th database mapping the scripts and the Languages detected with the documents where the Language is detected
- Fill the newly created database during indexing
- Create an allow-list with this database and pass it to Charabia
- Add a test ensuring that a Japanese request containing kanjis only is detected as Japanese and not Chinese
