Merge #3866

3866: Update charabia v0.8.0 r=dureuill a=ManyTheFish

# Pull Request

Update Charabia:
- enhance Japanese segmentation
- enhance Latin Tokenization
  - words containing `_` are now properly segmented into several words
  - brackets `{([])}` are no more considered as context separators so word separated by brackets are now considered near together for the proximity ranking rule
- fixes #3815
- fixes #3778
- fixes [product#151](https://github.com/meilisearch/product/discussions/151)

> Important note: now the float numbers are segmented around the `.` so `3.22` is segmented as [`3`, `.`, `22`] but the middle dot isn't considered as a hard separator, which means that if we search `3.22` we find documents containing `3.22`
