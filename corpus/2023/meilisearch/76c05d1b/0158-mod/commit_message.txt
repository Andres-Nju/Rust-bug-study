4053: Fix the stats of the documents deletion by filter r=Kerollmops a=irevoire

# Pull Request

The issue was that the operation « DocumentDeletionByFilter » was not declared as an index operation. That means the index stats were not reprocessed after the application of the operation.

## Related issue
Fixes #4018

## What does this PR do?
- Move the `DocumentDeletionByFilter` internal operation into the category of the `IndexOperation`. This means that the stats will automatically be re-processed after a batch is processed.
- Update a test to ensure that the stats are valid after each operation
