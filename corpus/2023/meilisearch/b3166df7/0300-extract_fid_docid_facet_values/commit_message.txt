3372: Enhance facet string normalization r=ManyTheFish a=ManyTheFish

# Pull Request

Use compatibility decomposition normalizer in facet string extraction in order to have a more human friendly sort order.

Now, [é (U+00E9)](https://www.compart.com/fr/unicode/U+00E9) is converted to [e (U+0065)](https://www.compart.com/fr/unicode/U+0065) + [◌́ (U+0301)](https://www.compart.com/fr/unicode/U+0301). This way any word starting with an accented/diacritized version of a character is put just after the words starting with the unaccented version of the character.
