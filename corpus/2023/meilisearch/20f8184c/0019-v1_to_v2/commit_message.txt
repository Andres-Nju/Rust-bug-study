3441: Fix import of dump v2 r=dureuill a=irevoire

# Pull Request
This bug was introduced because of a mistake we did earlier: We said the last version to export dump v2 was the v0.21.0 while it was the v0.22.0.
To fix the bug I updated our whole v2 reader to use the code from meilisearch v0.22.0.
Also:
- Import the bugged dump in the tests
- Test the import of this dump in the v2 reader and current reader
