## What does this PR do?
As reported the metrics feature was broken by still using and old reference to `meilisearch_auth::actions`. This commit switches to the new location, `meilisearch_types::keys::actions`.

The original issue was not *that* clear as to exactly what was broken, and the build logs have disappeared, but it seemed to just be this one line fix. If this is not the case and I've missed the mark let me know, and i'll head back to the drawing board.
