Rollup merge of #111238 - workingjubilee:fix-btree-cursormut-peek-prev, r=Amanieu

btree_map: `Cursor{,Mut}::peek_prev` must agree

Our `Cursor::peek_prev` and `CursorMut::peek_prev` must agree on how to behave when they are called on the "null element". This will fix rust-lang#111228.

r? `@Amanieu`
