fix(es/minifier): Abort seq inliner if var is not fn_local or reassigned (#7804)

**Description:**

It turns out that the original implementation of `infect`is incomplete
because it cannot cover function param, and the new implementation
introduced in #7772 is redundant because what
[terser](https://github.com/terser/terser/blob/master/lib/compress/tighten-body.js#L909C18-L909C28)
do is basically checking `fn_local`
