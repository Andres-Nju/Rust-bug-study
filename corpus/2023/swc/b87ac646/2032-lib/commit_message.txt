fix(es/minifier): Parse a file as a module only if `opts.module` is `true` (#7943)

**Description:**

Previously it was impossible to minify non-strict code (e.g. `delete identifier;`) because `minify()` unconditionally parsed the input as a module regardless of the `module` setting.

**BREAKING CHANGE:**

`minify()` now respects the `module` parameter instead of ignoring it, so users who had been processing modules with `minify()` without passing `{ module: true }` will now need to pass it.
