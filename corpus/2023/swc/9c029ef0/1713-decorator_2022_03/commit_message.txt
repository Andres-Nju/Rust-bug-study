feat(es/compat): Implement decorator metadata proposal (#8097)

**Description:**

This PR implements the [decorator
metadata](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorator-metadata) proposal,
that is now at Stage 3.

As the decorator metadata proposal is a small extension of the decorator
proposal and is not possible to compile the metadata without transpiling
decorators, I opted to implement it into the existing decorator
transformer (and helper)

 - Closes #7957
