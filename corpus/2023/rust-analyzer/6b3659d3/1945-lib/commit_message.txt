fix: deduplicate fields and types in completion

Fixes #15024

- `hir_ty::autoderef()` (which is only meant to be used outside `hir-ty`) now deduplicates types and completely resolves inference variables within.
- field completion now deduplicates fields of the same name and only picks such field of the first type in the deref chain.
