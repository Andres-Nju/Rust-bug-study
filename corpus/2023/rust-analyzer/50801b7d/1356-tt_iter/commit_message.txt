Auto merge of #13853 - veber-alex:diag_fix, r=Veykril

Use diagnostic code as link to full message

fixes #13823 by adding a vscode setting that will keeping the existing diagnostic code and use it as a link to the full compiler error message.
While I was there I also fixed `index` to fallback to `rendered.length` to make the previewRustcOutput feature work.
