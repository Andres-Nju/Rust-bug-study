fix: assignment operators are right associative

Fixes #14944

Assignment operators, be they simple or complex, are right associative in Rust ([reference]). We need to consider that fact when computing [binding power][bp] of infix operators.

The changes in `0072_destructuring_assignment.{rs,rast}` are unexpected, but I'm pretty sure it's a typo and fixed the `.rs` file accordingly.
