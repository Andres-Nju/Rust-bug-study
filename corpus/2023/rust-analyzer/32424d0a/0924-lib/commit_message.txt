Fix associated item visibility in block-local impls

Fixes #14046

When we're resolving visibility of block-local items...

> `self` normally refers to the containing non-block module, and `super` to its parent (etc.). However, visibilities must only refer to a module in the DefMap they're written in, so we restrict them when that happens. ([link])

 ...unless we're resolving visibility of associated items in block-local impls, because that impl is semantically "hoisted" to the nearest (non-block) module. With this PR, we skip the adjustment for such items.

Since visibility representation of those items is modified, this PR also adjusts visibility rendering in `HirDisplay`.
