Auto merge of #14714 - jhgg:hover/exclude-sized-trait-in-goto-actions, r=Veykril

fix: ide: exclude sized in go-to actions in hover

fixes #13163

i opted to just simply omit `Sized` entirely from go-to actions, as opposed to including it if even someone writes an explicit `T: Sized`, as i think a go-to on Sized is of dubious value practically.
