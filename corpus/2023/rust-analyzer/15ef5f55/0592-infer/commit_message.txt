Register obligations during path inference

Fixes #14635

When we infer path expressions that resolve to some generic item, we need to consider their generic bounds. For example, when we resolve a path `Into::into` to `fn into<?0, ?1>` (note that `?0` is the self type of trait ref), we should register an obligation `?0: Into<?1>` or else their relationship would be lost.

Relevant part in rustc is [`add_required_obligations_with_code()`] that's called in [`instantiate_value_path()`].
