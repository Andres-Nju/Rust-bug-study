Fix: Run doctests for structs with lifetime parameters from IDE

Fixes #14142: Doctests can't be triggered for structs with lifetimes

This MR adds lifetime parameters to the structs path for runnables so that they can be triggered from an IDE as well.

This is my first MR for rust-analyzer, please let me know if I should change something, either in code or the description here.
