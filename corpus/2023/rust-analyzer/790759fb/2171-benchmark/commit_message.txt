Support multi-character punct tokens in MBE

Fixes #11497

In the context of MBE, consecutive puncts are parsed as multi-character punct tokens whenever possible. For example, `:::` is parsed as ``[Punct(`::`), Punct(`:`)]`` and shouldn't get matched to patterns like `: : :` or `: ::`.

We have implemented this behavior only for when we match puncts against `tt` fragments, but not when we match puncts literally. This PR extracts the multi-character punct handling procedure into a separate method and extends its support for literal matching.

For good measure, this PR adds support for `<-` token, which is still [considered as one token in rustc](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e3961864075eaa9e855e5eec6b4f148029684539/compiler/rustc_ast/src/token.rs#L249) despite the placement syntax having been removed.
