Auto merge of #14920 - lowr:fix/overhaul-named-struct-to-tuple-struct, r=Veykril

Fix edits for `convert_named_struct_to_tuple_struct`

Two fixes:
- When replacing syntax nodes, macro files weren't taken into account. Edits were simply made for `node.syntax().text_range()`, which would be wrong range when `node` is inside a macro file.
- We do ancestor node traversal for every struct name reference to find record expressions/patterns to edit, but we didn't verify that expressions/patterns do actually refer to the struct we're operating on.
