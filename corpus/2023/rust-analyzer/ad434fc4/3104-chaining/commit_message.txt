Auto merge of #15157 - HKalbasi:tokio-test, r=HKalbasi

Fix runnable detection for `#[tokio::test]`

fix #15141

It is hacky, and it wouldn't work for e.g. this case:
```Rust
use ::core::prelude;

#[prelude::v1::test]
fn foo() {
}
```
But it works for the tokio case. We should use the name resolution here somehow, and after that we should probably also get rid of the ast based `test_related_attribute` function.
