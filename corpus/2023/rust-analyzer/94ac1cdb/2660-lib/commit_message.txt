Auto merge of #14715 - Veykril:symbol-index, r=Veykril

Refactor symbol index

Closes https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/issues/14677

instead of eagerly fetching the source data in symbol index we do it lazily now, this shouldn't make it much more expensive as we had to parse the source most of the time anyways even after fetching.
