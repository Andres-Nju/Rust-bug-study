Auto merge of #14735 - Veykril:forbid-relative-json, r=Veykril

internal: Forbid canonicalization of paths and normalize all rust-project.json paths

Closes https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/issues/14728
cc https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/pull/14430

- Removes canonicalization (and forbids it from being used in a sense, clippy could help here again with its lint in the future)
- Normalizes all paths in rust-project.json which we weren't doing in some cases
