Hermit updates

This PR does three things related to the Hermit target:

1.  Close https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/issues/3318.

    Non-unix Hermit has been supported since https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/pull/1292 and unix Hermit does not exist anymore.

2.  Update Hermit docs.

    [HermitCore/RustyHermit has been renamed to just Hermit.](https://rust-osdev.com/this-month/2023-08/#hermit-os-kernel)
    I took the chance to simplify the Hermit module's docs.

3.  Add the `riscv64gc-unknown-hermit` target to docs and CI (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/114004).
