Fix notify doing active polling

The `notify-debouncer-mini` spawn a thread which checks the events
every timeout, which is not desired since we want to avoid active
polling.

This commit re-implements debouncer based on the `RecommendedWatcher`
without adding an extra thread on top and not doing any busy-waiting.

Fixes #6652.
