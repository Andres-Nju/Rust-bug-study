Fix legacy bindings taking precedence over new ones

They were compared by len, but it's was wrong from the start, since
a user provided binding could remove more than one builtin binding,
so it was impossible for users to use their own bindings.

The most reliable way to do so is to use `Option`, given that we fill
default during deserialization.

Fixes #7050.
