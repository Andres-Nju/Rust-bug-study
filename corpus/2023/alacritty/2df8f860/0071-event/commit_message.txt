Fix selection rotation on the last line

This fixes an issue with terminal resizes when the selection is on the
last line. Alacritty would fail to rotate lines and keep the selection
in the same line index whenever the terminal line count was grown or
shrunk.

This issue occurred due to the range passed to the selection's rotate
function still being based on the old terminal size, which caused the
initial or target state of the rotation to be outside of the terminal
bounds.

Closes #6698.
