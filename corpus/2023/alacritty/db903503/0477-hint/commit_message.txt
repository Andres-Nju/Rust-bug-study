Update to the new winit keyboard API

The main highlight of this update is that alacritty will now use new
keyboard API from the winit, which resolves a lot of issues around
key bindings, such as ability to bind dead keys. It also fixes long
standing issues with the virtual key code bindings and make bindings
in general more predictable. It also makes our default Vi key bindings
fully working.

Given that alacritty was using `VirtualKey` directly in the bindings
from the winit, and winit simply removed the enum, we've added internal
conversions to minimize the fallout, but new way to specify the bindings
should be more intuitive.

Other part of this update fixes some forward compatibility bugs with the
Wayland backend, given that wayland-rs 0.30 is fully forward compatible.
The update also fixes weird Maximized startup issues on GNOME Wayland,
however they were present on any sane compositor.
