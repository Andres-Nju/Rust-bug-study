rt: panic if `EnterGuard` dropped incorrect order (#5772)

Calling `Handle::enter()` returns a `EnterGuard` value, which resets the
thread-local context on drop. The drop implementation assumes that
guards from nested `enter()` calls are dropped in reverse order.
However, there is no static enforcement of this requirement.

This patch checks that the guards are dropped in reverse order and
panics otherwise. A future PR will deprecate `Handle::enter()` in favor
of a method that takes a closure, ensuring the guard is dropped
appropriately.
