time: fix wake-up with interval on `Ready` (#5553)

When `tokio::time::Interval::poll_tick()` returns `Poll::Pending`, it
schedules itself for being woken up again through the waker of the
passed context, which is correct behavior.

However when `Poll::Ready(_)` is returned, the interval timer should be
reset but not scheduled to be woken up again as this is up to the
caller.

This commit fixes the bug by introducing a `reset_without_reregister`
method on `TimerEntry` which is called by `Intervall::poll_tick(cx)` in
case the delay poll returns `Poll::Ready(_)`.
