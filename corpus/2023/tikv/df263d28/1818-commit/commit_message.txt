raftstore-v2: check gc peer after commit merge (#15693)

close tikv/tikv#15672

This commit addresses the issue of orphan peers remaining in TiKV due to the
absence of GcPeer tick registration after commit merge. The lack of regular
checks on removed_records and merged_records can lead to delays in detecting
and resolving these issues.

To improve this, we have implemented a solution that ensures TiKV registers
the GcPeer tick after commit merge. This change enables regular checks on
the removed_records and merged_records, preventing them from being overlooked
for an extended period.
