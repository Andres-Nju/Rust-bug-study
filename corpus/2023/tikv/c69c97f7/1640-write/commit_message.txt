fix: find the correct last_change_ts after upgrade from versions < 6.5 (#14784)

close tikv/tikv#14780

When making a LOCK record, if we do not know `last_change_ts`, iterate to the 
last actual write to find out.
This also fixes the problem that ROLLBACK may prevent LOCKs making using of 
the optimization as mentioned in https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/13834
NOTE a implementation change:
If versions_to_last_change > 0 but last_change_ts == 0, the key does not
have a PUT/DELETE record before this write record, **OR the previous change is a DELETE**.
