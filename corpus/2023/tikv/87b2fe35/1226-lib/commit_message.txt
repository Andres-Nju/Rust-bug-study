resolved_ts: shrink resolver lock map (#15484)

close tikv/tikv#15458

Resolver owns a hash map to tracking locks and unlock events, and so
for calculating resolved ts. However, it does not shrink map even after
all lock are removed, this may result OOM if there are transactions
that modify many rows across many regions. The total memory usage is
proportional to the number of modified rows.
