raftstore-v2: fix destroy blocked by apply progress (#14223)

close tikv/tikv#14215

If a peer is marked for destroy, it will skip all apply result, which
will make it never apply to committed index. This PR relaxes the check
to last_applying_index and always process apply result.

It also fixes a bug that new peer created by large ID may not survive
restart.
