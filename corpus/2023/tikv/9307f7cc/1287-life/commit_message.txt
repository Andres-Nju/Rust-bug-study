raftstore-v2: fix MergedRecords not being cleaned up (#15650)

close tikv/tikv#15644

MergedRecords were not being properly cleaned up, causing unnecessary
bloating of RegionLocalState and continuous sending of GcPeerRequest by
raftstore.
This commit addresses the issue by enhancing the handling of
GcPeerRequests, ensuring that target region followers forward
GcPeerRequests to the source peer. The source peer or store then reports
GcPeerResponse accordingly.
