server: make cpu and heap profiling can be running concurrently (#15761)

close tikv/tikv#15760

Make cpu and heap profiling can be running concurrently. 
Beside, change the behavior of 
- "debug/pprof/heap_activate": do not dump heap profile periodically by default
- "debug/pprof/heap": dump heap profile without any delay and use embedded jeprof script
