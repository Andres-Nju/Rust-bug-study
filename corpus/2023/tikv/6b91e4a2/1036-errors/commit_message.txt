cdc: deregister delegate if memory quota exceeded (#15486)

close tikv/tikv#15412

Similar to resolved-ts endpoint, cdc endpoint maintains resolvers for
subscribed regions. These resolvers also need memory quota, otherwise
they may cause OOM.
This commit lets cdc endpoint deregister regions if they exceed
memory quota.
