raftstore-v2: fix incorrect GC peer requests to source peer after merge (#15643)

close tikv/tikv#15623

After merge, target region sends GC peer requests to removed source peers,
however the region_id in requests is set to target region id incorrectly.
As results, source region removed peers may be left forever.

This commit fixes above issue by putting source removed_records to
merged_records, so that region id can be set correctly.
