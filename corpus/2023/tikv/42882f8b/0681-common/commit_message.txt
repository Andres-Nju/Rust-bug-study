txn: Fix possible assertion failure in next_last_change_info (#15241)

close tikv/tikv#15109

This PR updates the way to calculate the last_change_info, which is not very proper before. This also fixes a assertion failure 
in `next_last_change_info` that might happen when it executes in parallel with GC in compaction filter.
