storage: Fix flow controller pending compaction bytes always be zero (#14393)

close tikv/tikv#14392

Fix the issue that flow control may not work when pending compaction bytes is high.

If the pending compaction bytes is 0, then 0.log2() is -INF which would cause the later
average always be zero even if the pending compaction bytes is already high.
