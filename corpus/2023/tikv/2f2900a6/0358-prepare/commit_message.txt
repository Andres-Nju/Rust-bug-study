raftstore-v2: fix issues related to background work (#15115)

ref tikv/tikv#12842, fix tikv/tikv#15145

- Raise error when block-cache or write-buffer-limit is set too high.
- Reduce write-buffer-limit ratio and max size.
- Fix `max-compactions` adjusting doesn't consider level zero files.
- Increase `max-manual-flush-rate` from 0.2 to 0.3.
- Fix pre flush doesn't call callback when tablet is missing.
- Move `pause_background_work` into background pool because it may block for a long time.
- Only split clean tablet.
- Schedule pre flush for commit merge in a dedicated merge because it blocks the source region.
- Print rocksdb stats once 2h for v2.
