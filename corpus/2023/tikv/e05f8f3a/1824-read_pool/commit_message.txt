read_pool: avoid get inconsistent sample sum and count from histogram (#14202)

close tikv/tikv#14200

We may get inconsistent state when calling `get_sample_sum` and
`get_sample_count` in a non-atomic fashion. This may cause unexpected
calculation result.

This PR calls `Histogram::metric` which uses a lock inside to guarantee
consistency. And the PR also adds protective checks to avoid dividing by zero.
