raftstore: Fix incorrect raftstore applys memory trace (#15372)

close tikv/tikv#15371

Fix incorrect raftstore applys memory trace. When performing dropping apply fsm, it should reset the 
memory trace to zero instead of calling `update_memory_trace`, otherwise it would record extra footage
of the interior vector capacity.
