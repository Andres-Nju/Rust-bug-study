copr: fix paging stop early unexpectedly with agg executors (#14292)

ref tikv/tikv#14209, close tikv/tikv#14291

#14209 stop paging when the result set is drained. But when supporting agg paging,
the executors will also return drained when there is enough data returned.
This PR label the drain reasons and stop following paging when the resultset is really drained.
