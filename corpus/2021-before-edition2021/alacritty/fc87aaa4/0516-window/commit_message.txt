Limit the maximum DPR on X11 to 10

Since there have a bunch of problems caused by an excessive DPI reported
by XRandr, this limits the maximum DPR on X11 to 10.

These issues would commonly cause problems like long startup times or
crashes, which are hard to troubleshoot for the user. While a limit of
10 might not eliminate all of these issues, it should still make it
possible for Alacritty to start to make troubleshooting simpler.

Fixes #3214.
