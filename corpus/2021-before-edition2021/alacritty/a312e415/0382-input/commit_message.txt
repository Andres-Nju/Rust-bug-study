Fix selection flooding Wayland connection

This resolves an issue where an excessive clipboard update frequency
would cause the Wayland display server to ignore necessary selection
updates.

Instead of copying the selection to the clipboard during the selection
process, it is now only copied once the mouse button is released.

Fixes #4953.
