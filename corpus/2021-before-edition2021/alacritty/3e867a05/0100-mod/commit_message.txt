Fix crashes with cut-off fullwidth characters

There's a few places in Alacritty where it was assumed that after a
WIDE_CHAR cell, there'd always be a WIDE_CHAR_SPACER. However since
resizes in the alternate screen buffer do not reflow any content, it's
possible to have a WIDE_CHAR without any WIDE_CHAR_SPACER right behind
it.

This patch changes these instances to be more defensive about accepting
potentially unreasonable input data caused by alt screen resizes.

Fixes #5185.
Fixes #5170.
