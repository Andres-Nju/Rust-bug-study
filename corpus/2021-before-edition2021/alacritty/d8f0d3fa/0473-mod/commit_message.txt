Fix vi cursor tracking during scrolling

This resolves an issue with the vi mode cursor where it would not keep
track of the content while scrolled up in history but instead slowly
leave the viewport due to its absolute positioning.

While an alternative solution would have been to always keep the vi mode
cursor in the same spot on the viewport, keeping track of the content is
not only more easy to implement but it also makes for a nicer connection
between the vi mode cursor and the content below it.

Fixes #5339.
