Merge #10456

10456: fix: Avoid cycle when lowering predicates for associated item lookup r=flodiebold a=jonas-schievink

Fixes https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/10386

(the salsa bug persists, but this lets us avoid it by fixing the underlying bug)

This reimplements the rustc logic in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b27661eb33c74cb514dba059b47d86b6582ac1c2/compiler/rustc_typeck/src/collect.rs#L556: When resolving an associated type `T::Item`, we've previously lowered all predicates that could affect `T`, but we actually have to look only at those predicates whose traits define an associated type of the right name.
