raftstore: fix the region meta inconsistency bug during splitting (#9495)

### What problem does this PR solve?

Issue Number: close https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/8783

Problem Summary:
https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/8783#issuecomment-708298415
The bug is located in function `on_ready_split_region` which is introduced by https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/8084.
https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/7c9850040ba58d48f0f1a93345c0392dffb2fc5b/components/raftstore/src/store/fsm/peer.rs#L2084-L2112
Line 2111 `continue` means this region has already existed so it should be skipped.
But line 2087-2090 has already added this region to `region_ranges` which leads to metadata inconsistency.

### What is changed and how it works?

What's Changed:
Fix this bug and add 2 tests.

Run `test_split_not_to_split_existed_tombstone_region ` and `test_split_not_to_split_existed_different_uninitialied_peer` can panic in different place in previous code.
