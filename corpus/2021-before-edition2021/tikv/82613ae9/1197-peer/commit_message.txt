### What problem does this PR solve?

Issue Number: close #9517 

Problem Summary:

After applying snapshot the `ReadDelegate` stored at `StoreMeta` will be replaced with the new one, but the removed one didn't call `mark_invalid` to notify the `ReadDelegate` store at `LocalReader` to remove itself and cause the `LocalReader` always return ` mismatch peer id`

https://github.com/tikv/tikv/blob/35c66d38ff8180f3652643e35575590d9ab57fc1/components/raftstore/src/store/peer.rs#L1750-L1755

### What is changed and how it works?
What's Changed:

People can easily forget to call `mark_invalid` when a `ReadDelegate` is removed from `StoreMeta`, instead, we can call `mark_invalid` when the `ReadDelegate` (the one stored at `StoreMeta`) is dropped.
