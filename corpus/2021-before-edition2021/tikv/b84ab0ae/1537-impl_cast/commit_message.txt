### What problem does this PR solve?

Issue Number: close #9704 <!-- REMOVE this line if no issue to close -->

Problem Summary: 

    drop table t;
    create table t (a varchar(30));
    insert into t values ('');
    delete from t where a=10;

Delete statement should be ok. In MySQL, the result of empty stringcasting to float is zero. But in TiDB, it gives "Data Truncated" errors. Because cast expr got bug when cast empty string to float.

That was fixed in TiDB [here](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/10806), but we still need to fix it in copr. 

### What is changed and how it works?

What's Changed:  Change function cast_string_as_signed_real(). When input string is empty, result will be 0.0
