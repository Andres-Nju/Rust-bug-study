### What problem does this PR solve?

Issue Number: close #9654

### What is changed and how it works?

This PR is to fix an incorrect assertion. See the unit test of this PR, the secondary lock of a pessimistic transaction may bypass rollback checks (e.g. an index key in TiDB). So the original assertion is not always true.
