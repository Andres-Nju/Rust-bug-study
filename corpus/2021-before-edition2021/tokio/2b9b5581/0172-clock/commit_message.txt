time: prevent `time::advance` from going too far (#3712)

Previously, `time::advance` would set the mocked clock forward the
requested amount, then yield. However, if there was no work ready to
perform immediately, this would result in advancing to the next expiring
sleep.

Now, `time::advance(...)` will unblock at the requested time. The
difference between `time::advance(...)` and `time::sleep(...)` is a bit
fuzzy. The main difference is `time::sleep(...)` operates on the current
task and `time::advance(...)` operates at the runtime level.

Fixes #3710
