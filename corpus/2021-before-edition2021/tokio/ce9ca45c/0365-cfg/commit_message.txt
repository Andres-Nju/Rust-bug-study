doc: fix invalid `#[doc(inline)]` warnings on latest nightly. (#3788)

This commit fixed issue #3787 by removing [doc(inline)] from
macro `cfg_macros` and added proper #[doc(inline)] attributes
to `pub use` items inside `cfg_macros` calls.

It's probably not `cfg_macros`s responsibility to inlining public
macros, though it's conveninent to do so. Notice that in lib.rs:

cfg_macros! {
    /// Implementation detail of the `select!` macro. This macro is **not**
    /// intended to be used as part of the public API and is permitted to
    /// change.
    #[doc(hidden)]
    pub use tokio_macros::select_priv_declare_output_enum;

    ...
}

`#[doc(hidden)]` and `#[doc(inline)]` are conflict with each other
in the sense of correctness.

Fixes: #3787
