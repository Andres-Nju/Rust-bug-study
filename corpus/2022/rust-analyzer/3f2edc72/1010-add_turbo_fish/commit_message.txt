Merge #11136

11136: Turbo fish assist supports multiple type arguments r=matklad a=Vannevelj

This fixes #11135 (changelog: bug).

I've only started using Rust a few days ago but saw this issue on the top of the list when I looked at this repo. I based myself on [this blog post](https://techblog.tonsser.com/posts/what-is-rusts-turbofish) to understand what a "turbo fish" is so let me know if I missed anything.
