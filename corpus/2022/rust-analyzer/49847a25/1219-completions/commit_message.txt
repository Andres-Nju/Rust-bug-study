Merge #11883

11883: fix(ide): move moudle directory when rename r=rainy-me a=rainy-me

fix: #10992

Added `FileSystemEdit::MoveDir` variant for move dirs. Original implemented as recursively move child mod files but had many issues like

1. left empty dir after rename file
2. only affect rust file
3. not performant

so changed to current version
