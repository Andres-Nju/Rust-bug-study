11878: fix: Paper over GAT panic r=flodiebold a=flodiebold

TIL that Chalk expects the arguments to a generic associated type to come *before* the ones for the parent trait, not *after* as we have been doing with all other nested generics. Fixing this requires a larger refactoring, so for now this just papers over the problem by completely ignoring parameters of associated types.

Fixes #11769.
