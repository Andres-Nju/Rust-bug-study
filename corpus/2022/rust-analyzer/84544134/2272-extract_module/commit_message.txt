fix: Insert `pub(crate)` after doc comments and attribute macros

Fixes #12790

Original behavior was to insert `pub(crate)` at the `first_child_or_token`, which for an item with a comment or attribute macro, would put the visibility marker before the comment or macro, instead of after.

This merge request alters the call to find the node with appropriate `SyntaxKind` in the `children_or_tokens`. It also adds a test case to the module to verify the behavior. Test case verifies function, module, records, enum, impl, trait, and type cases.
