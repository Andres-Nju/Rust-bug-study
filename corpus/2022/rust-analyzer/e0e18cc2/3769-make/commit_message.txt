Auto merge of #13151 - ChayimFriedman2:replace-turbofish-other-type, r=Veykril

Use correct type in "Replace turbofish with type"

And support `?` and `.await` expressions.

Fixes #13148.

The assist can still show up even if the turbofish's type is not used at all, e.g.:
```rust
fn foo<T>() {}
let v = foo::<i32>();
```
