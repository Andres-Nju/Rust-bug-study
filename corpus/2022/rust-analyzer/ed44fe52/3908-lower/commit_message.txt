Auto merge of #12668 - Veykril:mac-source-map, r=Veykril

fix: Simplify macro statement expansion handling

I only meant to fix https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/issues/12644 but that somehow turned into a rewrite of the statement handling ... at least this fixes a few more issues in the IDE layer now
