Auto merge of #13185 - ChayimFriedman2:insert-ws-in-static-const-macro, r=Veykril

fix: Insert whitespaces into static & const bodies if they are expanded from macro on hover

Partially fixes #13143.

To resolve the other part we need to expand macros in unevaluated static & const bodies, and I'm not sure we want to. If for example it includes a call to `assert!()`, expanding it will lead to worse hover.
