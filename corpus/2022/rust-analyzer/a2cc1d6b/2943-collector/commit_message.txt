Merge #11538

11538: feat: Make private editable completions configurable, disable by default r=Veykril a=Veykril

Fixes https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/10253
Fixes https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/9885

This does disable these completions by default, as it seems that people find this behaviour surprising(due to other IDEs usually not doing this).
