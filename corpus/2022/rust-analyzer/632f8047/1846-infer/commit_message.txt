fix: normalize projection after discarding free `BoundVar`s in RPIT

Fixes #13307

When we lower the return type of a function, it may contain free `BoundVar`s in `OpaqueType`'s substitution, which would cause panic during canonicalization as part of projection normalization. Those `BoundVar`s are irrelevant in this context and will be discarded, and we should defer projection normalization until then.
