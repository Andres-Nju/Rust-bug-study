Auto merge of #13239 - mdx97:mathew/fix-add-reference-for-macros, r=Veykril

Fix add reference action on macros.

Before we were using the range of the corresponding expression node in the macro expanded file, which is obviously incorrect as we are setting the text in the original source.

For some reason, the test I added is failing and I haven't found a way to fix it. Does anyone know why `check_fix` wouldn't work with macros? Getting this error:

```text
thread 'handlers::type_mismatch::tests::test_add_reference_to_macro_call' panicked at 'no diagnostics', crates/ide-diagnostics/src/handlers/type_mismatch.rs:317:9
```

closes #13219
