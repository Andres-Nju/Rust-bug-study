fix: only shift `BoundVar`s that come from outside lowering context

Fixes #13734

There are some free functions `TyLoweringContext` methods call, which do not know anything about current binders in scope. We need to shift in the `BoundVar`s in substitutions that we get from them (#4952), but not those we get from `TyLoweringContext` methods.
