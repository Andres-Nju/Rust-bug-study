Merge #11789

11789: fix: Fix lifetime elision hint configuration key r=Veykril a=Veykril

This is inconsistent with the other configuration keys unfortunately, but this is an issue of how we structured them here in general.

I feel like we'll have to do a proper pass over all the configs, check them for consistency and then write down some documentation of how our configs should be laid out, then apply fixes to the inconsistencies all at once which will entail breaking some user configurations unfortunately since we won't be able to do proper fallback handling for some of these.
