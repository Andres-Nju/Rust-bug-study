Auto merge of #12789 - DorianListens:dscheidt/unused-param-overlapping, r=DorianListens

fix: Prevent panic in Remove Unused Parameter assist

Instead of calling `builder.delete` for every text range we find with
`process_usage`, we now ensure that the ranges do not overlap before removing
them. If a range is fully contained by a prior one, it is dropped.

fixes #12784
