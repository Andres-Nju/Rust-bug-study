Auto merge of #13064 - Veykril:rustfmt-err, r=Veykril

Log rustfmt parsing errors as warnings

We unconditionally pass an edition parameter to rustfmt, for some crates
this might fail rustfmt so instead of swallowing the error, at least Log
it on a level that is logged by default so users won't be completely
confused about it.
