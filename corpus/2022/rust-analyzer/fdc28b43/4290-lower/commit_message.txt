fix: Fix panics on GATs involving const generics

This workaround avoids constant crashing of rust analyzer when using GATs with const generics,
even when the const generics are only on the `impl` block.

The workaround treats GATs as non-existing if either itself or the parent has const generics and
removes relevant panicking code-paths.

Fixes #11989, fixes #12193
