fix: sort all bounds on trait object types

Fixes #13181

#12793 allowed different ordering of trait bounds in trait object types but failed to account for the ordering of projection bounds. I opted for sorting all the bounds at once rather than splitting them into `SmallVec`s so it's easier to do the same thing for other bounds when we have them.
