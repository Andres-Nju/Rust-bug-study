11195: Correctly pass through reference modifiers when extracting a variable r=Veykril a=Vannevelj

Fixes https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/10034

This will parse the field expression and look at whether it is marked `&` or `&mut` and include a modifier if appropriate. The original issue only mentions `&mut params` but I've found that this issue also occurs for `&mut locals` as well as `&params` and `&locals` so I've also added tests for them.

I'd definitely be interested in hearing where I can make my code more idiomatic for Rust.

11202: fix: Fix `apply_demorgan` assist hanging for certain binary expressions r=Veykril a=Veykril
