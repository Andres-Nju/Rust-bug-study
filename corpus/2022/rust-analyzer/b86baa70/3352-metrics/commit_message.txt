Merge #11560

11560: internal: Update `url` to make `webrender` build when computing metrics r=jonas-schievink a=lnicola

Closes #9997

This doesn't seem to affect the metrics, but I'm not sure since somehow I get different values than what shows up on CI.

With `stable`:

```
  exprs: 94151, ??ty: 96 (0%), ?ty: 25 (0%), !ty: 6
```

CI shows 16.

Also, https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/pull/7250 strikes again, I can never tell what those numbers are.
