fix(common): Fix `BytePos` -> `CharPos` calculations (#6574)

**Description:**

This fixes the BytePos -> CharPos calculation necessary for source maps.
There were a few issues in the old code:

1. UTF-8 maps 1-3 bytes into 1 UTF-16 char, but 4 bytes into 2 UTF-16 chars
2. The starting offset was not recorded when we reached the end of the `multibyte_chars` iteration
3. The `mappings` can be unordered, meaning we need to restart the UTF-16 offset calculation
