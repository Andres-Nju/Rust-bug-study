raftstore: bucket and region split bug fix (#12620)

close tikv/tikv#12597

1) originally the split by keys only support CheckPolicy::Scan. Add CheckPolicy::Approximate support. 
2) refine the way to use approximate size for split---calculate the actual split count per region size instead of use batch_split_limit
3) refine the bucket_version logic to make it monotonic----basically keep the region_buckets in last_region_buckets on split/merge
