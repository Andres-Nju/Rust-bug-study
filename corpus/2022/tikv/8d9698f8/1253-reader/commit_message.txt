storage: Unify the flashback reader and fix the start_key bug (#13860)

close pingcap/tiflash#6379, ref tikv/tikv#13800, close tikv/tikv#13861

SnapshotReader typically uses its own start_ts for something. Since it doesn't need the start_ts of SnapshotReader itself,  
we can unify the reader into MvccReader.
And the start key from the client is actually a range, which is used to limit the upper bound of this flashback when scanning data, so it may not be a real key.
