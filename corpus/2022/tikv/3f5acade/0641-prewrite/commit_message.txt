storage: skip Rollback when checking newer version for non-pessimisitc keys (#13426)

close tikv/tikv#13425, ref pingcap/tidb#35525

Don't treat newer Rollback records as write conflicts for non-pessimistic
keys in pessimistic transactions. They can cause false positive errors
because they can be written even if the pessimistic lock of the
corresponding row key exists.

Rollback records are only used to prevent retried prewrite from
succeeding. Even if the Rollback record of the current transaction is
collapsed by a newer record, it is safe to prewrite this non-pessimistic
key because either the primary key is rolled back or it's protected
because it's written by CheckSecondaryLocks.
