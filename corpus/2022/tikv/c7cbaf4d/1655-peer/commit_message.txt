raftstore: ignore stale read states (#12300)

close tikv/tikv#12046

If a read index request travel too long in the network, a leader may receive the
request it sent when it's still follower and break the strict order pending read
assumption.

This PR solves the problem by ignoring invalid read states. It also adds a defense
check to ignore all ReadIndex messages when it's sent by current leader.
