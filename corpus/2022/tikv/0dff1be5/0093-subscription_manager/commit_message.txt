log-backup: don't run the cond function if the entry state is removal (#13043)

close tikv/tikv#13044

`SubscriptionManager::deregister_region_if` won't call the `cond` argument 
if the target has been removed by setting the state to `Removal`.
This would fix some patterns like:
let mut exists = false;
subs.deregister_region_if(42,|_, _| exists = true);
do_with(exists);
