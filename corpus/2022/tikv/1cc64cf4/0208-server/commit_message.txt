server: do not update background cpu limit when auto-tune is off (#13056)

ref tikv/tikv#12679, close tikv/tikv#13055

ThreadTime is collected when the cpu limit in the QuotaLimiter
is not infinity.

#12679 updated the background cpu limit even if auto-tune is off,
which is unnecessary. So, that causes additional cost of collecting
thread CPU time in some critical paths.

This commit sets cpu_time_limit of the QuotaLimiter only if auto-tune
is enabled, so we don't waste effort to collect CPU time when
auto-tune is not enabled.
