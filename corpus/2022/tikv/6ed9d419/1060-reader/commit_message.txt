storage: refactor flashback to use the MVCC overwriting (#13450)

ref tikv/tikv#13303, close tikv/tikv#13448

Since deleting the old MVCC keys directly will cause the GC Compaction Filter to mishandle the deletion entry,
this PR refactors the `FlashbackToVersionReadPhase` and `FlashbackToVersion` commands to use the MVCC
overwriting to achieve the flashback.
