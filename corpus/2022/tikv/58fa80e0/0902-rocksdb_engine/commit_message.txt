storage: precheck whether the peer is leader when acquiring latches failed (#13254)

close tikv/tikv#12966, ref tikv/tikv#12966

When a tikv is isolated from other tikv instances, some requests will be 
blocked in raftstore and the corresponding latches are not released. 
Following requests which require the latches will receive ServerIsBusy error
and keep retrying. However, In such case, peers on the tikv are not leader
anymore. The client is supposed to receive NotLeader error immediately.

This commit introduces fail fast mode to scheduler. When a request 
fails to acquire any latch, scheduler checks if the peer is still leader.
If it still the leader, schedule the request as usual, fail fast otherwise.
