raftstore: allow a read-only flashback request to be propsed (#13871)

close tikv/tikv#13870, fix tikv/tikv#13870

Because the flashback read request must be proposed after the `PrepareFlashback`
and it won't have any side effects, it's safe to allow a read-only flashback request to
be proposed. In this way, we can also fix #13870.
