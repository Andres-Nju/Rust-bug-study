raftstore: move scan delete to raft log gc worker (#11853)

* raftstore: move scan delete to raft log gc worker

When clearing raft metas, raftstore will scan raft logs and delete them
one by one. Seeking can be slow if there are a lot of tombstone keys.
This PR moves the operation to raft log gc worker to reduce the impact.

The final solution should be also moving remaining IO operations to
async write IO threads.

Close #10210.
