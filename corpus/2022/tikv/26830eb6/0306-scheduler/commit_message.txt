scheduler: Optimize CPU usage of waking up (#13697)

close tikv/tikv#13692, ref tikv/tikv#13692

Optimize CPU usage of waking up.

1. When popped entries are empty in `on_release_locks`, do not do anything in the high priority pool. This seems to be the reason of the performance regression mentioned in #13692 .
2. Skip waking up if the `LockWaitQueues` is empty.
