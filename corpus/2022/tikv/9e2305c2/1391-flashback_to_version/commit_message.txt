storage: fix the flashback dead loop caused by a deleted key (#13744)

close tikv/tikv#13743

The original thought is that when a key's latest MVCC record type is DELETE and the corresponding flashback operation is also DELETE, we skip it to avoid duplicated writing.
However, this will cause the flashback to fall into a dead loop since the key doesn't have the written record with the flashback `commit_ts` and the flashback will always try to write it forever.
