Skip write `prewrite_lock` in flashback locks (#13960)

close tikv/tikv#13958, ref tikv/tikv#13958

Since the rollback ts for flashback are derived from the ts of the lock, we wrote prewrite lock which start_ts is flashback in Prewrite Phase. 
So the Prewrite lock we wrote in the flashback was rollbacked when we retry prepare. 
This introduces the case mentioned in https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/13958
The solution is: if such a lock exists, skip it and go to the Commit Phase.
