raftstore: skip deleting snapshot files in peer pending_remove is true (#11782)

* raftstore: skip deleting snapshot files in peer when the peer is pending removal and the snapshot is being applied and canceled -- close #11746

This is to avoid the potential panic when the snapshot files are deleted, but the peer's status (Tombstone) is not persisted in disk due to tikv crash.
