mvcc: fix get_write may return Delete when skipping versions (#13840)

close tikv/tikv#13839

The mvcc get_write methods should return None if the found record is a Delete.

This constraint is broken after the introduction of skipping locks, causing
panic when reading values.

Now, it's changed to use the same logic in the loop (just like the PointGetter and
the ForwardScanner) to avoid the problem.
