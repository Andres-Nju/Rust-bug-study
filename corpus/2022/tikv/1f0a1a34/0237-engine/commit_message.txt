raftstore: fix high commit log duration when adding new peer  (#13078)

close tikv/tikv#13077

When adding a new peer, `alive_cache_idx` would not consider the new peer still
in applying snapshot. Then it may trigger compacting entry cache due to 
`alive_cache_idx` being equal to `applied_idx`. After the snapshot is applied,
the log gap of new peer is not in entry cache, which triggers async fetch to 
read disk. 

Considering raft engine's read performance is not as good as rocksdb's, once 
there are a lot of Regions triggering async fetch, the process of replicating
log to new peer would be slow. If there is a conf change promoting the learner
and demoting another peer, the commit index can't be advanced in joint state
because the to-be-learner peer doesn't catch up logs in time.
