Fix span of byte-escaped left format args brace

Fix #102057 (see issue for example).

Previously, the use of escaped left braces (`\x7B`) in format args resulted in an incorrectly offset span. This patch fixes that by considering any escaped characters within the string instead of using a constant offset.
