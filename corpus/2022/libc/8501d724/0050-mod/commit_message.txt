Auto merge of #2944 - thomcc:apple-iconv, r=JohnTitor

Don't link against iconv on apple targets when used by `std`

See https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/issues/2870 (and specifically my, erm, rant in https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/issues/2870#issuecomment-1271104762). I think we should probably remove it outright, but we definitely shouldn't have it in every Rust program by giving it to `std`.
