2207: Fix: avoid embedding the user input into the error response. r=Kerollmops a=CNLHC

# Pull Request

## What does this PR do?
Fix #2107. 

The problem is meilisearch embeds the user input to the error message. 

The reason for this problem is `milli` throws a `serde_json: Error` whose `Display` implementation will do this embedding.  

I tried to solve this problem in this PR by manually implementing the `Display` trait for `DocumentFormatError` instead of deriving automatically.
