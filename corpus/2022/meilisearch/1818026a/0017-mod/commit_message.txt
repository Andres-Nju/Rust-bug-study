2057: fix(dump): Uncompress the dump IN the data.ms  r=irevoire a=irevoire

When loading a dump with docker, we had two problems.
After creating a tempdirectory, uncompressing and re-indexing the dump:
1. We try to `move` the new “data.ms” onto the currently present
   one. The problem is that if the `data.ms` is a mount point because
   that's what peoples do with docker usually. We can't override
   a mount point, and thus we were throwing an error.
2. The tempdir is created in `/tmp`, which is usually quite small AND may not
   be on the same partition as the `data.ms`. This means when we tried to move
   the dump over the `data.ms`, it was also failing because we can't move data
   between two partitions.
------------------
1 was fixed by deleting the *content* of the `data.ms` and moving the *content*
of the tempdir *inside* the `data.ms`. If someone tries to create volumes inside
the `data.ms` that's his problem, not ours.
2 was fixed by creating the tempdir *inside* of the `data.ms`. If a user mounted
its `data.ms` on a large partition, there is no reason he could not load a big
dump because his `/tmp` was too small. This solves the issue; now the dump is
extracted and indexed on the same partition the `data.ms` will lay.

fix #1833
