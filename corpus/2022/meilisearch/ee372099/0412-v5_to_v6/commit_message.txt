Merge #3160

3160: Clamp databases max size to the page size r=irevoire a=Kerollmops

This PR fixes #3150 (again #2662). We fix it again, here, as we entirely rewrote the index scheduler and forgot about this little detail.

`@irevoire` Can I have your input on where we create the indexes in the tests? I want to use a non-page-size rounded value in the tests. This way, we can see this issue in the tests next time.
