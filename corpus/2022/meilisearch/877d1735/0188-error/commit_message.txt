3077: Don't remove DB if unreadable r=irevoire a=dureuill

# Pull Request

## Related issue
Related to #3069

Will fix it after merging into `main`

## What does this PR do?

### User standpoint

- When the DB cannot be read after opening it, Meilisearch exits with an error message like previously, but it now leaves the DB untouched
- When the DB cannot be read after importing it from a snapshot or dump, it is still removed, like previously.

### Dev standpoint

- Add new local enum `OnFailure` that is used as a parameter to the `meilisearch_builder` closure to control when to keep or remove the DB in case of failure.
