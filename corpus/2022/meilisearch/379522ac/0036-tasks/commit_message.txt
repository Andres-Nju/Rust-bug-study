3023: Update error codes related to tasks cancelation + add canceledBy filter r=Kerollmops a=Kerollmops

<details>This PR changes the error codes [to follow the specification](https://github.com/meilisearch/specifications/pull/195).

 - [x] The `missing_filters` error code is renamed `missing_task_filters` to be more accurate and follow the `invalid_task_*` convention.
 - [x] The error code `invalid_task_uids_filter` is added.
 - [x] The error code `invalid_task_canceled_by_filter` is added.
 - [x] The error code `invalid_task_date_filter` is added.
      -  The error message is the same as for expires_at in the API Key  EXCEPT that it does not explicitly mention that a date must be given in the future.
</details>

Edit by `@loiclec` :
I have added a few more changes into this PR. The related issues are:

- Fixes https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/3029
- Implements https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/3026
- Fixes https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/2940
- Fixes https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/issues/2939

Additionally:
- Fixes a bug where global tasks were returned by `GET /tasks` queries even if the user did not have the `index.*` API key action.
- Rename `originalQuery` to `originalFilters`
- Display `error: null` and `canceledBy: null` in the task views
- Allow using the star operator in the task filters in the `DELETE /tasks` and `POST /tasks/cancel` routes
- Make sure that the index scheduler keeps making progress even when a grave error occurs.
