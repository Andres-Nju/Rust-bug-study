2281: Hard limit the number of results returned by a search r=Kerollmops a=Kerollmops

This PR fixes #2133 by hard-limiting the number of results that a search request can return at any time. I would like the guidance of `@MarinPostma` to test that, should I use a mocking test here? Or should I do anything else?

I talked about touching the _nb_hits_ value with `@qdequele` and we concluded that it was not correct to do so.

Could you please confirm that it is the right place to change that?
