Fix OSC 4 color response format

The commit 60ef17e introduced support for the color query response
escape for OSC 4, however it did omit the `4;` prefix and started the
OSC with just the color index.

This patch fixes this bug and correctly responds to queries with full
OSC 4 format, including prefix plus color index.

Fixes #5981.
