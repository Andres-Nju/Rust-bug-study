rt: fix `*_closed` false positives (#5231)

Readiness futures inconsistently return the current readiness of an I/O resource if it is immediately available, or all readiness relevant for the given `Interest`, if a future needs to wait. In particular, it always returns `read_closed` for `Interest::READABLE` and `write_closed` for `Interest::WRITABLE`, which often is not true. Tokio should not tolerate false positives for `*_closed` events because they are considered final states and are not cleared internally.

In the case of an `io_resource.ready(Interest::READABLE | Interest::WRITABLE)` call, this behavior may also lead to false positives of other events.

## Solution

Follow the same strategy as `poll_ready` and return the current resource's readiness.

Closes: #5098
