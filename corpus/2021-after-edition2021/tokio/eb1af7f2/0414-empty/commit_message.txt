io: make `tokio::io::empty` cooperative (#4300)

Reads and buffered reads from a `tokio::io::empty` were always marked
as ready. That makes sense, given that there is nothing to wait for.
However, doing repeated reads on the `empty` could stall the event
loop and prevent other tasks from making progress.

This change uses tokio's coop system to yield control back to the
executor when appropriate.

Note that the issue that originally triggered this PR is not fixed
yet, because the `timeout` function will not poll the timer after
empty::read runs out of budget. A different change will be needed to
address that.
