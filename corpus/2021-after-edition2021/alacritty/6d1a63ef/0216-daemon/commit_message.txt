Remove shared PID/FD variables

The existing PID/FD atomics in alacritty_terminal/src/tty/unix.rs were
shared across all Alacritty windows, causing problem with the new
multiwindow feature.

Instead of sharing these between the different windows, the master FD
and shell PID are now stored on the `window_context`.

Unfortunately this makes spawning new daemons a little more complicated,
having to pass through additional parameters. To ease this a little bit
the helper method `spawn_daemon` has been defined on the
`ActionContext`, making it accessible from most parts of Alacritty's
event loop.

Fixes #5700.
