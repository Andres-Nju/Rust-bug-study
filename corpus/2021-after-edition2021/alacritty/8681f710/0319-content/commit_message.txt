Add parameters to `msg create-window` subcommand

Alacritty's `msg create-window` subcommand would previously inherit all
the CLI parameters from the original executable. However not only could
this lead to unexpected behavior, it also prevents multi-window users
from making use of parameters like `-e`, `--working-directory`, or
`--hold`.

This is solved by adding a JSON-based message format to the IPC socket
messages which instructs the Alacritty server on which CLI parameters
should be used to create the new window.
