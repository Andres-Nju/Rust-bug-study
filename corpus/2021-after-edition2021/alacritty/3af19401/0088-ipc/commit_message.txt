Fix CreateNewWindow CLI fallback

The existing behavior for the new CreateNewWindow actions was to always
pass in their own options, which would discard the existing options
configured on the terminal's PTY config.

To fix this the behavior for CreateNewWindow is now the same as for the
initial window creation, the config values are overwritten conditionally
based on their individual presence in the CLI options.

However all temporary CLI options set on the "master" Alacritty
instance are discarded by all future windows.

Fixes #5659.
